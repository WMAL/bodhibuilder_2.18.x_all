Notes for bodhibuilder 2.18.x

***HOW TO -- Create file /etc/bodhibuilder/uefi/ISOLINUX/isohdpfx.bin like this
  >    dd bs=512 count=1 if=/etc/bodhibuilder/uefi/ISOLINUX/isolinux.bin of=/etc/bodhibuilder/uefi/ISOLINUX/isohdpfx.bin



NEED TO -- move Packages.gz creation to the 'iso' function. That way a user can add their own deb files to
            /home/bodhibuilder/bodhibuilder/ISOTMP/dists/pool/ when doing a 'Distcdfs' spin.

NEED TO -- add a check to see if the system has been dist-upgraded, and stop ISO creation if not upgraded
            (bodhibuilder, bodhibuilder.conf, bodhibuilder-gtk.py, bodhibuilder-gtk.glade)

NEED TO -- add a '-u' option to update the deb files that are in /etc/bodhibuilder/debs/amd64/ (i386 does not need deb files of offline install)
            but first, before updating those debs, the current linux system needs to be up to date
            1. do an 'apt-get update'
            2. check to see if there are any updates available through apt-get
                apt list --upgradable    OR
                apt-get -s dist-upgrade    OR
                sudo apt-get -V -u dist-upgrade --assume-no | grep '^.*upgraded.*newly installed.*to remove.*not upgraded'    (a formatted version of this is probably the best option)    OR
                sudo apt-get -V -u dist-upgrade --assume-no | tail -n+6 | head -n-5 | awk '{print$1}'    OR
                sudo apt-get -V -u dist-upgrade --assume-no | tail -n+6 | head -n-5 | awk '{print$1}' | tr '\n' '\ '
            3. download the new deb files only if the system is fully dist-upgraded

Need to -- fix the 10 minute screen timeout in the created ISO. (maybe fixed in non-enlightenment 'desktops')
            (not sure if enlightenment/bodhi desktops need this)

Need to -- figure out how to get a UEFI spin to install on a non-UEFI machine.  (low priority)

Need to -- create a ubiquity slideshow for bodhibuilder (will be using bodhi-slideshow until then)

Need to -- upgrade files /usr/share/bodhibuilder-gtk/{bodhibuilder-gtk.glade,bodhibuilder-gtk.py} to GTK 3+  (low priority)

Need to -- figure out how to get a popup box instead of a popup terminal when bodhibuilder-gtk is launched in Lubuntu (low priority)
